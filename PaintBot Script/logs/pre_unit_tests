This script should utilize the four cameras positioned near the nozzle of the paint sprayer to detect and avoid windows and doors.\n\nImport necessary libraries and modules from paint.py and map.py.\n\nInitialize four cameras positioned around the nozzle of the paint sprayer. Two cameras should be 15 cm to the left of the nozzle; one positioned half the distance of the spray_jet_width variable from map.py upwards, and the other the same distance downwards.

Use color filtering techniques to isolate the green and red colors in the images.\n   - Use contour detection to identify the tapes based on their unique striped pattern.\n\n4. **Detection Logic**:\n   - Implement logic to keep track of the color sequence (red followed by green or vice versa).\n   - Calculate the distance from the detected tape to the nozzle using the camera's field of view and resolution.\n\n5. **Control Logic**:\n   - If the sequence is red followed by green and the distance to the tape is 5 cm, send a G-code command to stop the paint sprayer. This can be done by interfacing with the `robot_control` class from `paint.py`.\n   - If the sequence is green followed by red and the distance to the tape is 5 cm, send a G-code command to resume the paint sprayer.\n\n6. **Logging and Monitoring**:\n   - Log all actions taken by the script, including when the paint sprayer is stopped or resumed, and the positions of the detected tapes.\n   - Implement monitoring to ensure that the cameras are functioning properly. If a camera fails or the tapes are not detected, log an error and implement a fallback strategy, such as stopping the robot or alerting the operator.\n\n7. **Error Handling**:\n   - Implement error handling for camera failures, image processing errors, or communication errors with the robot.\n   - Define a clear protocol for how the system should behave in case of different types of errors.\n\n8. **Testing and Validation**:\n   - Thoroughly test the script in a controlled environment with various window and door configurations.\n   - Validate that the robot accurately stops and resumes painting based on the tape detections and that it does not paint over the tapes.\n\n9. **Documentation**:\n   - Document the code clearly, explaining the purpose of each function and the logic behind the image processing and control algorithms.\n   - Provide instructions on how to integrate and run this script alongside `paint.py` and `map.py`.\n\nThis script should be designed with robustness and reliability in mind, ensuring that it can effectively control the paint spraying robot in a real-world environment."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Specification:\n\nSpecification for Avoid Window Paint Spraying Robot Program (Revised)\n\n1.
