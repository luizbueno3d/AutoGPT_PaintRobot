The `yolov5_training/dataset/train/images` directory is meant to store the training images for the YOLOv5 model. It is not a file that contains code. Instead, it is a folder where you should place the images of walls, windows, and edges that will be used to train the YOLOv5 model. 

To prepare the dataset, you should collect images of walls, windows, and edges, and place them in the `yolov5_training/dataset/train/images` directory. Make sure the corresponding annotation files are placed in the `yolov5_training/dataset/train/labels` directory.
